              <h4>Personal Essay</h4>
              <h2>My Life's Inflection Point</h2>
              <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to read my essay. Your
                consideration means a great deal to me. <br />

                Growing up, I always admired my dad's passion for photography
                and videography. It wasn’t until a winter vacation crisis that I
                truly stepped into his shoes, taking on the responsibility of
                capturing a couple's most important day while also protecting my
                dad's business reputation. <br />
                My dad used to run a photography and videography business and he
                had been hired for an Ethiopian wedding. When he fell ill right
                before the event, I saw the desperation in his eyes. He was
                determined to be there for the couple but his illness left him
                drained and overwhelmed. <br />
                Seeing my dad struggle stirred a deep sense of empathy within
                me. I couldn’t just stand by and watch him bear this burden,
                especially knowing how much this wedding meant to both him and
                the couple. In that moment, I felt a strong sense of
                responsibility to step up and support him. I knew I had to help
                him fulfill his commitment, which became a defining moment of
                growth and self-discovery for me. My values of responsibility
                and family loyalty motivated me to take action. Having grown up
                observing my dad's work, I had always been a spectator with many
                questions during the early days of the business. However, in
                that moment of urgency and uncertainty, I realized it was time
                for me to step up. <br />
                Determined to fulfill the contract with the customer and ensure
                the couple's memories were beautifully captured, I resolved to
                coordinate the camera crew on the spot. Drawing on my seven
                years of experience in soccer, where I developed strong
                coordination skills, I recognized valuable parallels between
                leading a soccer team and managing a camera crew. I understood
                that just as in soccer, where teamwork is essential for success,
                effective collaboration among the camera crew would be crucial
                in capturing the wedding beautifully. I understood that
                assigning roles, timing our actions and maintaining effective
                communication were essential in both environments. With this
                insight, I focused on implementing these principles throughout
                the wedding. <br />
                After the event, as I reviewed the raw footage, a sense of pride
                washed over me. My dad's expression of gratitude and pride meant
                everything to me. Seeing the relief on my dad’s face, especially
                after such a long day, filled me with joy and highlighted the
                importance of what I had done. This moment deepened our bond and
                taught me a valuable lesson about stepping outside my comfort
                zone. It reinforced my belief that taking initiative can lead to
                personal growth and strengthen relationships. I realized that
                resilience and adaptability are essential when unexpected
                challenges arise. <br />
                This experience strengthened my belief in servant leadership and
                the meaningful impact we can have by helping others. I’m eager
                to carry these lessons into my future, both academically and in
                my efforts to create a supportive and inclusive environment. As
                I move forward, I will forge my own path by prioritizing the
                needs of those around me and becoming a person that leads not by
                authority but by example. True leadership means serving others
                and creating an environment where everyone feels valued and
                inspired. As I face the challenges and opportunities for growth
                ahead, I am excited to share my experiences and values with a
                community that inspires and supports one another.
