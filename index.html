              <h4>Personal Essay</h4>
              <h2>My Life's Inflection Point</h2>
              <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to read my essay; your
                consideration means a great deal to me.
                <br />
                Growing up, I always admired my dad's passion for photography
                and videography. But it wasn't until a winter vacation crisis
                propelled me into a whirlwind of growth and self-discovery that
                I stepped into his shoes and took on the responsibility of
                capturing a couple's most important day, while also protecting
                my dad's business reputation.
                <br />
                My father used to run a photography and videography business and
                a customer had hired him for his Ethiopian wedding day. But when
                my dad was on the brink of withdrawing from his commitment at
                the last minute because he fell ill, I could see the desperation
                in his eyes. He was determined to capture every moment of this
                significant day, but his battle with a severe illness left him
                feeling drained and overwhelmed.
                <br />
                Witnessing my dad struggle with the weight of the situation
                stirred a deep sense of empathy within me. I couldn't stand by
                and watch him bear this burden, especially knowing how much the
                wedding meant to both him and the couple. My values of
                responsibility and family loyalty motivated me to take action.
                Having grown up observing my dad's work, I had always been a
                spectator, but in that moment of urgency and uncertainty, I
                realized it was time for me to step up.
                <br />
                Determined to fulfill the contract with the customer and ensure
                the couple's memories were beautifully captured, I resolved to
                coordinate the camera crew on the spot. Drawing on my seven
                years of experience in soccer, where I developed strong
                coordination skills, I recognized valuable parallels between
                leading a soccer team and managing a camera crew. I understood
                that assigning roles, timing our actions, and maintaining
                effective communication were essential in both environments.
                With this insight, I focused on implementing these principles
                throughout the wedding.
                <br />
                After the event, as I reviewed the raw footage, a profound sense
                of pride washed over me. My dad's expression of gratitude and
                pride meant everything to me. Seeing the relief on his face,
                especially given how exhausted he was, filled me with happiness
                and reinforced the significance of my efforts. This experience
                not only deepened my connection with my dad but also taught me
                the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing
                challenges. I learned that resilience and adaptability are
                crucial when faced with unexpected situations, and that taking
                initiative can lead to personal growth.
                <br />
                Ultimately, this experience has reinforced my belief in the
                power of servant leadership and the profound impact we can have
                when we choose to help others. I am excited to carry these
                lessons forward, not only in my academic pursuits but also in my
                commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment.
                As I move forward, I will forge my own path by prioritizing the
                needs of those around me and becoming a person that leads not by
                authority but by example - showing that true leadership is about
                serving others and creating an environment where everyone feels
                valued and inspired. As I embrace the challenges and growth that
                lie ahead, I am eager to contribute my experiences and values to
                a community that inspires and supports one another.
